I'm an inventor. My work touches on economics, human-computer interaction, and social psychology. 

I believe [econ 101 is outdated](#econ101) and I've developed new models of [consumer search](#meaingful-choice), [consumer planning](#web-scale-activity-search), and [affiliation](#affiliation).

Since 1993 I have studied [rapid affiliation](#affiliation), including [just-in-time teamwork](#teamwork), the provisioning of [intimacy and empathy among strangers](#intimacy), and [markets in interaction and rapport](#rapport).

Since 2012 I have also begin to study [Rapid Lifestyle Change, Activity Searches, and the Internet](#internet-and-lifestyle)

I've been lousy at getting my work out. I plan to publish and demo more in 2013 and 2014.

# My work

## <a id="affiliation"></a> Rapid Affiliation

Strong preferences for affiliation and rapport determine much of how we spend our time and money.  These factors are reported as key both for healthy communities and for [lives well lived](#lives-well-lived).  Which cirumstances are conducive to strangers coming together quickly, either to work together or to share in various kinds of rapport and social interaction?  Answering this question has involved work with [couchsurfing](http://couchsurfing.org) on trust, search, and priming, with disaster relief organizations [1](http://google.com?q=emergency+communities) [2](http://groundcrew.us), and with games and social art projects at various scales.

See below:

* [Just-In-Time Teamwork](#teamwork)
* [Markets in Interaction and Rapport](#rapport)
* [Provisioning Intimacy and Empathy among Strangers](#intimacy)


## <a id="teamwork"></a> Just-In-Time Teamwork

My earliest experiments with just-in-time teamwork involved writing software and throwing game-like events, and this has remained the pattern.

The first event, in 2001, was a "trustfall dinner party", in which the steps to make a complex gourmet meal were distributed across several rooms in a house, shuffled among participants, and arranged so as to require precision timing and coordination in seven phases triggered by a house-wide bell system.  The software is lost to an ancient harddrive, but see below for more recent work.


#### Technology

I've created software for forming just-in-time opt-in teams with high opt-in rates and high performance.  These have been tested in environments ranging from art museum openings to disaster sites.

There's [CEML, a programming language](http://github.com/citizenlogistics.com/ceml).  Here's sample code. [[1]](#fn1)

```
"Harass and report"
gather attacker, victim within 1 block
ask victim re clothing: What are you wearing?
assign attacker: 
    Find someone wearing |clothing| and harass them.
assign victim:
    Someone will harass you.  Notice how it feels.
    Then fill out this google spreadsheet form
    to describe your experience.
    http://spreadsheet.google.com/foo
tell both: thanks so much for participating!

```

And there's [Groundcrew, a realtime teambuilding command console](http://groundcrew.us).

#### Ongoing events

I run a monthly playtest for realworld games and a yearly festival in SF.  Many of the games presented by others involve just-in-time teamwork, and often they are also about turning nonaffiliated strangers into affiliated groups in some public or semi-public-space venue.

* The Playtest:  [SandboxSF](https://www.facebook.com/groups/496677353748745/)
* The Festival:  [Come Out and Play SF](http://comeoutandplaysf.org)


#### Teamwork games I've made that you can play

* **Clandestine Film School** involves two decks of cards and a pack of hair clips, and is meant to be played in cafes where people work with their laptops and might like to work together instead.  One deck is a deck of "role cards" -- "director", "actor", "star", "interviewer", "cameraman".  The other has missions -- "a 6sec love story about mugs", "a 2min doco about lives of baristas", "a very subtle action adventure", etc.  Someone gives out cards and those who have roles and need to join mission team wear the hairclips.  Hashtags collect the media.  *Presented at SandboxSF in July '13 and played at Arbor in Oakland*.

* **Card Parties** are events where guests at a party are assigned precisely-timed tasks, distributed on little cards or via SMS.  Tasks interweave. Strangers find themselves in intimate encounters, quiet moments, facing challenges together, being theatrical, etc.  I have [an old FAQ](/misc/notecard-party-faq.html) for running one of your own and [some software and a mission database](http://github.com/jxe/Participatorium) that will help.


#### Experiments

* *Trustfall Dinner* (2001)&mdash;
   A computer program was used to scramble the
  instructions of several gourmet recipes and to assign guests at
  the dinner party cooking tasks in such a manner that it was
  difficult for anyone to guess what was being prepared until the
  very end. A primary focus was on the mechanics of danger and
  trust -- for instance, in having one participant leave something
  prone to burning on the stove and having another participant
  remove it.

* *Ruby Goldberg Instruction Series* (2005-) -- Everyone at an open mic or other gathering sends a text message and receives one back from a server.  Each text has an instruction with a trigger event and an action to be taken by the recipient, for instance: "Take off your shoe. When you hear the bell, step into the aisle and hold up your shoe and shake it."  Someone else would receive: "When you see someone shaking one of their shoes in the air, begin to tell a short (20 second) story about your childhood."

* *Card Parties* (2002-2011) -- detailed above.

* *Cadre Events, Missions* -- the software detailed above was deployed and refined at events at YBCA, CoAPSF 2011, and at several Occupy Wall Street sites!






## <a id="rapport"></a> Markets in Interaction and Rapport

What are the most fulfilling things that can happen to a person in an evening or a day?  An emotional breakthrough, a breathtaking vista, a playful conversation with a loved one, the resolution of a longstanding logistical or material problem, a return to an aspect of oneself...

The market for these fulfilling experiences is unusual in that provisioning experiences requires unusual insight into and influence over personality and state, and the criteria for consumer search are poorly understood by both consumers and providers.  These goods are all either experience goods or credence goods which means they cannot be selected from a catalogue.

It is instructive to create situations where there are many providers of potentially fullfilling experiences and many consumers, and various attempts to coordinate can be studied and engineered.

**Learned:** There is a certain regularity to the things that emerge as frequently fulfilling in these environments.  [Diagram of Desires and Rapports](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlreore5l5rixmx/desires-and-rapports.pdf).  There is also regularity to the information we need about a person in order to address interactions and rapports they will engage in to them, and regularity to the ways that "vendors" of interaction and rapport need to present themselves in order to be browsable and engagable.  (I hope to give a talk about these things.)


#### Ongoing events

Since 2011, I've co-lead a crew that makes immersive experiences in public space.  Often simple.  Often beautiful.  Sometimes vaguely illegal.  These events are all multi-party markets in interaction and rapport.  They are physical markets, just like a farmer's market, and we have been making adjustments to optimize the emergence of the right audience-member / fulfilling experience transactions.

* EV: Garden Party
* EV: Matchstick
* EV: Breadbox

* EV: Bernal Piano


#### Interaction games you can play yourself 

* **Numbers**.  This is a super-simple game you can play at any kind of event.  If you have twenty guests, pass out twenty slips of paper, numbered 1-20.  The goal is to end the evening with the number 1.  Announce that anyone can, if they find someone with a number lower than theirs, ask for a challenge.  The challenge should be possible and ideally, fun.  If they succeed, they get to trade for the lower number.  What happens is that people make more and more creative challenges for one another, and the challenges become lightweight designed experiences that are reproduced on their own merits.  *Played at COaPSF 2012 and many dinenr parties.*

* **Pantheon** - a theater piece for 12 actors that need to be unlocked by the audience.  In *Pantheon*, every actor gets a binder of games to play and stories to exchange with audience members, and makes a secret decision before the show about what kind of presentation from an audience member will wake them from silence.  The binders are being collaboratively written.  Join us!

* **Yenta** - *down for the moment, help me get it back up* - an webapp that watches the twitter public feed for people that feel "bored" or are asking for something from "anyone".  When it finds two people who are both bored at the same time and live near one another, it asks the user if they'd like to suggest something for both people to do together.  This becomes a double @reply introducing the pair.  The user scores a point if their suggestion drives engagement between the two.

* **Microperformance potluck** - This is a kind of event where people get together to eat and participate in eachother's projects.  Each attendee brings a thing for the whole group to do together or to witness in less than 2 minutes.  A timer is set and if any partipant uses more than two minutes of the group's time, they are tackled and carried out of the room by the audience.



#### Experiments

* **Northampton Adventure Exchange** (2007) -- Residents of the small town of Northampton, MA filled out an online form where they specified a kind of quality they wanted to have added to their lives.  The choices included "surprise", "peace and quiet", "danger", "challenge", "warmth", etc.  They also reported their schedules.  A massive potluck was held once a week in which 30+ people attempted to pair up people from the database and make adventures for them to go on together which related to their desires.

* **Take to the Streets Radio** (2005)&mdash;was a radio show and weekly street event for more than a year. We give listeners instructions every week for public space adventures near the centers of Northampton and Florence, MA.  Each week there was a guest adventure designer.

* **Wish-fulfillment Card Parties** (2006,2007) -- At daylong events with 300 people, everyone was asked to make a wish for something that could realistically happen to them at the event that they would love.  A team of 30 people used a group editing and revision process to derive assignments for all 300 that, taken together, would make each person's wish come true.

* **EarthSync** (2006)&mdash;A social calendar-sharing website.  Allowed you to see what all of your geographically-dispersed friends are doing today and "sync-up" by doing the same thing at the same time.

* **Share a Quiet Moment with a Distant Stranger** (2006)&mdash;A web installation.  Spend a minute or two in synchronous silent contemplation with a stranger somewhere else on Earth. Users are given the relative compass bearing and degreesbelow-the-horizon of their companions, so as to more fully feel "with" them in contemplation.

* **Inaction at a Distance** (2003)&mdash;
  Site-specific performance.  Two people stand quietly, shoulder
  to shoulder, 250 miles apart, for 10 minutes.  Synchronized to
  atomic time, they inhale at the same moment to begin.
  Performed three times in NYC and VT.

* **Geoloitering** (2003)&mdash;
  Email/physical installation. For more than a month, I spent part
  of each day standing quietly in Vermont while elsewhere in the
  world (Ireland, Australia, New Mexico, Japan, etc) a complete
  stranger was also standing quietly

* **Invoke** (2000)&mdash;
  Web/physical installation.  A gift-exchange community was
  created. Participants were making, hiding, and finding postcards
  in back pages of low-circulation books in the San Francisco
  public library. Each user would enter the call number and page
  of a book within which he or she would like to receive a
  postcard, and within a week another user would place one there.

* **Continuous Play** (2008)&mdash;A performance collaboration with choreographer <a href="http://www.inmixedcompany.com/">Maura Donohue</a> in which the audience switches from passive to very active performers, directed via SMS, over the course of the evening.
