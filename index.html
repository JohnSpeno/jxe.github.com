I'm an inventor. My work touches on economics, human-computer interaction, and social psychology. 

I believe [econ 101 is outdated](#econ101) and I've developed new models of [consumer search](#meaingful-choice), [consumer planning](#web-scale-activity-search), and [affiliation](#affiliation).

Since 1993 I have studied [rapid affiliation](#affiliation), including [just-in-time teamwork](#teamwork), the provisioning of [intimacy and empathy among strangers](#intimacy), and [markets in interaction and rapport](#rapport).

Since 2012 I have also begin to study [Rapid Lifestyle Change, Activity Searches, and the Internet](#internet-and-lifestyle)

I've been lousy at getting my work out. I plan to publish and demo more in 2013 and 2014.

# My work

## <a id="affiliation"></a> Rapid Affiliation

Strong preferences for affiliation and rapport determine much of how we spend our time and money.  These factors are reported as key both for healthy communities and for [lives well lived](#lives-well-lived).  Which cirumstances are conducive to strangers coming together quickly, either to work together or to share in various kinds of rapport and social interaction?  Answering this question has involved work with [couchsurfing](http://couchsurfing.org) on trust, search, and priming, with disaster relief organizations [1](http://google.com?q=emergency+communities) [2](http://groundcrew.us), and with games and social art projects at various scales.

See below:

* [Just-In-Time Teamwork](#teamwork)
* [Provisioning Intimacy and Empathy among Strangers](#intimacy)
* [Markets in Interaction and Rapport](#rapport)


## <a id="teamwork"></a> Just-In-Time Teamwork

#### Technology

I've created foundational technology for forming just-in-time opt-in teams with high opt-in rates and high performance.  These have been tested in environments ranging from art museum openings to disaster sites.

There's [CEML, a programming language](http://github.com/citizenlogistics.com/ceml).  Here's sample code.

And there's [Groundcrew, a realtime teambuilding command console](http://groundcrew.us).  A screenshot.

And [LibDeck.js, a javascript library that abstracts multi-person, multi-role scheduling and buy-in](javascript:alert('oops - open source it'))

* TODO: LibDeck sample code and obj

## <a id="lives-well-lived"></a> Consumer Demand for a Life Well Lived

Colloquially it makes sense when we say that someone is *more of* a consumer or *less of* a consumer.  But do we mean anything at all relative to the technical meaning of the word?
