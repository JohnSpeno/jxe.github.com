	<li><a href="/misc/notecard-party-faq.html">Notecard Parties</a> 2002-2012&#8212; All guests at a party are assigned precisely-timed tasks, distributed on little cards or via SMS.  Tasks interweave. Strangers find themselves in intimate encounters, quiet moments, facing challenges together, being theatrical, etc.  In some versions (2004-2006) tasks were developed by an onsite team, based on the wishes and dreams of the party guests themselves.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Selected Works</h2>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Tryst</b> (2011)&mdash;A text-messaging rig that organized rendezvous and subtle mobs at the <a href="http://openengagement.info/">Open Engagement</a> conference. With <a href="http://thachr.com">Sara Thacher.</a>  (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1945964">script file</a>)  (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1893654825104&set=a.1891648734953.2104507.1353540046&type=3&theater">photos</a>)
  </li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Continuous Play</b> (2008)&mdash;A performance collaboration with choreographer <a href="http://www.inmixedcompany.com/">Maura Donohue</a> in which the audience switches from passive to very active performers, directed via SMS, over the course of the evening. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/inmixedcompany/2291504845/">photos</a>)
  </li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li><b>EarthSync</b> (2006)&mdash;A social calendar-sharing website.  Allowed you to see what all of your geographically-dispersed friends are doing today and "sync-up" by doing the same thing at the same time.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Take to the Streets Radio</b> (2005)&mdash;A radio show and weekly street event for more than a year. We give listeners instructions every week for public space adventures near the centers of Northampton and Florence, MA.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Share a Quiet Moment with a Distant Stranger</b> (2006)&mdash;A web installation.  Spend a minute or two in synchronous silent contemplation with a stranger somewhere else on Earth. Users are given the relative compass bearing and degreesbelow-the-horizon of their companions, so as to more fully feel "with" them in contemplation.</li>
	</ul>

  <ul><li>
  <b>Inaction at a Distance</b> (2003)&mdash;
  Site-specific performance.  Two people stand quietly, shoulder
  to shoulder, 250 miles apart, for 10 minutes.  Synchronized to
  atomic time, they inhale at the same moment to begin.
  Performed three times in NYC and VT.
  </li></ul>
  
  <ul><li>
  <b>Geoloitering</b> (2003)&mdash;
  Email/physical installation. For more than a month, I spent part
  of each day standing quietly in Vermont while elsewhere in the
  world (Ireland, Australia, New Mexico, Japan, etc) a complete
  stranger was also standing quietly
  </li></ul>
  
  <ul><li>
  <b>Trustfall Dinner</b> (2001)&mdash;
   A computer program was used to scramble the
  instructions of several gourmet recipes and to assign guests at
  the dinner party cooking tasks in such a manner that it was
  difficult for anyone to guess what was being prepared until the
  very end. A primary focus was on the mechanics of danger and
  trust -- for instance, in having one participant leave something
  prone to burning on the stove and having another participant
  remove it.
  </li></ul>

  <ul><li>
  <b>Invoke</b> (2000)&mdash;
  Web/physical installation.  A gift-exchange community was
  created. Participants were making, hiding, and finding postcards
  in back pages of low-circulation books in the San Francisco
  public library. Each user would enter the call number and page
  of a book within which he or she would like to receive a
  postcard, and within a week another user would place one there.
  </li></ul>
