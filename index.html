I'm an inventor. My work touches on economics, human-computer interaction, and social psychology. 

I believe [econ 101 is outdated](#econ101) and I've developed new models of [consumer search](#meaingful-choice), [consumer planning](#web-scale-activity-search), and [affiliation](#affiliation).

Since 1993 I have studied [rapid affiliation](#affiliation), including [just-in-time teamwork](#teamwork), the provisioning of [intimacy and empathy among strangers](#intimacy), and [markets in interaction and rapport](#rapport).

Since 2012 I have also begin to study [Rapid Lifestyle Change, Activity Searches, and the Internet](#internet-and-lifestyle)

I've been lousy at getting my work out. I plan to publish and demo more in 2013 and 2014.

# My work

## <a id="affiliation"></a> Rapid Affiliation

Strong preferences for affiliation and rapport determine much of how we spend our time and money.  These factors are reported as key both for healthy communities and for [lives well lived](#lives-well-lived).  Which cirumstances are conducive to strangers coming together quickly, either to work together or to share in various kinds of rapport and social interaction?  Answering this question has involved work with [couchsurfing](http://couchsurfing.org) on trust, search, and priming, with disaster relief organizations [1](http://google.com?q=emergency+communities) [2](http://groundcrew.us), and with games and social art projects at various scales.

See below:

* [Just-In-Time Teamwork](#teamwork)
* [Markets in Interaction and Rapport](#rapport)
* [Provisioning Intimacy and Empathy among Strangers](#intimacy)


## <a id="teamwork"></a> Just-In-Time Teamwork

My earliest experiments with just-in-time teamwork involved writing software and throwing game-like events, and this has remained the pattern.

The first event, in 2001, was a "trustfall dinner party", in which the steps to make a complex gourmet meal were distributed across several rooms in a house, shuffled among participants, and arranged so as to require precision timing and coordination in seven phases triggered by a house-wide bell system.  The software is lost to an ancient harddrive, but see below for more recent work.


#### Technology

I've created software for forming just-in-time opt-in teams with high opt-in rates and high performance.  These have been tested in environments ranging from art museum openings to disaster sites.

There's [CEML, a programming language](http://github.com/citizenlogistics.com/ceml).  Here's sample code. [[1]](#fn1)

```
"Harass and report"
gather attacker, victim within 1 block
ask victim re clothing: What are you wearing?
assign attacker: Find someone wearing |clothing| and harass them.
assign victim:
    Someone will harass you.  Notice how it feels.
    Then fill out this google spreadsheet form
    to describe your experience.
    http://spreadsheet.google.com/foo
tell both: thanks so much for participating!

```

And there's [Groundcrew, a realtime teambuilding command console](http://groundcrew.us).

#### Ongoing events

I run a monthly playtest for realworld games and a yearly festival in SF.  Many of the games presented by others involve just-in-time teamwork, and often they are also about turning nonaffiliated strangers into affiliated groups in some public or semi-public-space venue.

* The Playtest:  [SandboxSF](https://www.facebook.com/groups/496677353748745/)
* The Festival:  [Come Out and Play SF](http://comeoutandplaysf.org)


#### Teamwork games I've made that you can play

* **Clandestine Film School** involves two decks of cards and a pack of hair clips, and is meant to be played in cafes where people work with their laptops and might like to work together instead.  One deck is a deck of "role cards" -- "director", "actor", "star", "interviewer", "cameraman".  The other has missions -- "a 6sec love story about mugs", "a 2min doco about lives of baristas", "a very subtle action adventure", etc.  Someone gives out cards and those who have roles and need to join mission team wear the hairclips.  Hashtags collect the media.  *Presented at SandboxSF in July '13 and played at Arbor in Oakland*.

* **Card Parties** are events where guests at a party are assigned precisely-timed tasks, distributed on little cards or via SMS.  Tasks interweave. Strangers find themselves in intimate encounters, quiet moments, facing challenges together, being theatrical, etc.  I have [an old FAQ](/misc/notecard-party-faq.html) for running one of your own and [some software and a mission database](http://github.com/jxe/Participatorium) that will help.


#### Experiments

* *Trustfall Dinner* (2001)&mdash;
   A computer program was used to scramble the
  instructions of several gourmet recipes and to assign guests at
  the dinner party cooking tasks in such a manner that it was
  difficult for anyone to guess what was being prepared until the
  very end. A primary focus was on the mechanics of danger and
  trust -- for instance, in having one participant leave something
  prone to burning on the stove and having another participant
  remove it.

* *Ruby Goldberg Instruction Series* (2005-) -- Everyone at an open mic or other gathering sends a text message and receives one back from a server.  Each text has an instruction with a trigger event and an action to be taken by the recipient, for instance: "Take off your shoe. When you hear the bell, step into the aisle and hold up your shoe and shake it."  Someone else would receive: "When you see someone shaking one of their shoes in the air, begin to tell a short (20 second) story about your childhood."

* *Card Parties* (2002-2011) -- detailed above.

* *Cadre Events, Missions* -- the software detailed above was deployed and refined at events at YBCA, CoAPSF 2011, and at several Occupy Wall Street sites!

* EV: Tristan


* **EarthSync** (2006)&mdash;A social calendar-sharing website.  Allowed you to see what all of your geographically-dispersed friends are doing today and "sync-up" by doing the same thing at the same time.

* **Share a Quiet Moment with a Distant Stranger** (2006)&mdash;A web installation.  Spend a minute or two in synchronous silent contemplation with a stranger somewhere else on Earth. Users are given the relative compass bearing and degreesbelow-the-horizon of their companions, so as to more fully feel "with" them in contemplation.

* **Inaction at a Distance** (2003)&mdash;
  Site-specific performance.  Two people stand quietly, shoulder
  to shoulder, 250 miles apart, for 10 minutes.  Synchronized to
  atomic time, they inhale at the same moment to begin.
  Performed three times in NYC and VT.

* **Geoloitering** (2003)&mdash;
  Email/physical installation. For more than a month, I spent part
  of each day standing quietly in Vermont while elsewhere in the
  world (Ireland, Australia, New Mexico, Japan, etc) a complete
  stranger was also standing quietly

* **Invoke** (2000)&mdash;
  Web/physical installation.  A gift-exchange community was
  created. Participants were making, hiding, and finding postcards
  in back pages of low-circulation books in the San Francisco
  public library. Each user would enter the call number and page
  of a book within which he or she would like to receive a
  postcard, and within a week another user would place one there.

* **Continuous Play** (2008)&mdash;A performance collaboration with choreographer <a href="http://www.inmixedcompany.com/">Maura Donohue</a> in which the audience switches from passive to very active performers, directed via SMS, over the course of the evening.

## <a id="lives-well-lived"></a> Consumer Demand for a Life Well Lived

Colloquially it makes sense when we say that someone is *more of* a consumer or *less of* a consumer.  But do we mean anything at all relative to the technical meaning of the word?

1. There used to be a hosted version of CEML that let you try it yourself and attach scripts to twilio phone numbers for text message coordination.  That's down right now but I hope to get it back up soon.
