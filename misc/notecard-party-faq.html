<h1>Notecard Parties</h1>

<hr />

<p>FAQ v0.1</p>

<h3>what is a notecard party?</h3>

<p>A party in which everyone in attendance receives a set of notecards, each indicating an action that must be performed and a time at which to perform
it.</p>

<h3>what's the point?</h3>

<p>Usually the actions on people's notecards interweave in surprising ways.  For instance:</p>

<ol>
<li>one person is told to put newspaper and scissors in the bathroom</li>
<li>another person is told to gather friends and have a boat race in the bathtub</li>
<li>a third is told to go to the bathroom and give a play-by-play of the events there</li>
</ol>

<p>Each person is pleasantly surprised by the others' cards, and by the support they receive in their activity unexpectedly.  This creates an attitude of trust and adventure at the party.  In addition, it can be a good way for strangers at the party to get to know each other, and it certainly makes for a more eventful occasion than the average chips and beer event.</p>

<h3>who came up with this?</h3>

<p>I did.  So far as I know, no one else has orchestrated these kinds of little events that are surprising even to the people who participate in them.</p>

<p>It is, however, very similar to something Neal Stephenson made up for his Diamond Age book:  the "Reformed Distributed Republic" described on page 377 of the paperback.  An anarchist nation that is held together as a mutually trusting community by these kinds of trustfall events.</p>

<p>There are also resonances with the short story "The Lottery of Babylon" by Jorge Luis Borges, in which an entire society is run by lottery.</p>

<p>And of course they are always compared to Happenings and Flash Mobs.</p>

<h3>how many of these have you done?</h3>

<p>I have done about 10 parties, ranging in size from 20 people to about 120, although it should be able to scale to much larger groups (e.g., nations) just fine.  The first was a dinner party in 2001 in which all of the food was prepared without anyone knowing what the recipes were, shifting from task to task when bells rang according to their cards.</p>

<p>I have also done about 10 more intimate notecard events.  For instance, in London I distributed the following four cards, each to be performed outside St.Paul's cathedral:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stand pointing for a few minutes at St.Paul's, wearing a red hat.</li>
<li>Look for someone wearing a red hat.  Pull their finger.</li>
<li>You will need a small bell.  Someone will be wearing a red hat.  Someone else will approach that person and pull their finger.  Then: ring your bell.</li>
<li>You will need a small bell.  Someone will be wearing a red hat.  Someone else will approach that person and pull their finger.  Then: ring your bell.</li>
</ol>

<h3>how do I throw a notecard party?</h3>

<p>I have used different techniques for producing the cards:</p>

<p>1)  For intimate occasions, I have just written them myself.  I am clever.</p>

<p>2)  In 2002 I used the following technique:  I sat with the other planners of the party in a circle.  Each of us would write a single card that was somehow risky for the person doing it.   Then we would pass the card to our left.  We would look at the card we received and make a new card that could somehow support that card.  Then pass both cards.  If/when a set of cards received was deemed to be complete, it was set aside with a paperclip.  At the end, these "vignettes" were ordered and given times appropriate to the timespan of the party and the density with which we wanted things to happen.</p>

<p>3) In 2003 &amp; 2004 I started basing the cards off of "wishes".  I had everyone at the party make a wish, and actually had volunteers from among the party participants work with me to make each wish into 2-5 notecards that were related to the wish.  Coordinating all of this proved to be a lot of work, but it is especially fulfilling when someone shouts "that was my wish!  my wish came true!"</p>

<p>4) This year I plan to make a hybrid between technique #2 and #3.  I will have everyone at the party make a wish <em>in the form of a notecard</em> (i.e., with a time, place, and action on it).  Rather than supervising volunteers at the party and making all the supporting cards for these wish cards at once, I will build a "wish realization station" with instructions and a chart.</p>

<p>A good trick in difficult environments is to hand out a few cards early, then wait till they go off.  Ask the crowd for a show of hand of people who were involved and liked it, and then ask who else wants to try a card.  Pretty soon you will be deluged.</p>

<p>I have also generally let people trade cards, but this trading must be done covertly so that the secrets don't come out.</p>

<h3>Where can I see more examples?</h3>
